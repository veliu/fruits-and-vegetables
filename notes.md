- Would have rather used PSL but image was missing some php extensions
- Why still php8.0? Missed enums, readonly, and ctor property promotion 
- For unit handling I'd rather use existing libraries
- Composer json requires php8.0 but docker image uses 8.1
- Because of composer conflicts could not install psalm and php-cs-fixer
